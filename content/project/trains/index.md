title: Robust journey planner
summary: Together with a team of colleagues, leveraged big data from SBB, the Swiss national railway company, and built a robust journey planner for the city of Zurich, using Spark and Hadoop. The results obtained were the same as Google Mapsâ€™, but we included additional features. Learned to proficiently engineer data, and use Big Data languages.
