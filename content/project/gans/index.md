title: Synthetic data generation with GANs
summary: Study with the goal to generate realistic synthetic images of C. elegans, in order to then apply this architecture in applications where data is scarce, and hard to gather. Used a StyleGAN2-ADA architecture and achieved visually realistic deformations of the real C. elegans images.
