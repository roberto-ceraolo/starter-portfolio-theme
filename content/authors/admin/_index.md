I am a Master student in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) and I have two souls: a business one and an engineering one. Prior to attending EPFL, I studied at Bocconi University where I developed my business acumen and learned the importance of soft skills. To achieve this, I was actively involved in student associations and startups. Together with a group of fellow students, I co-founded Bocconi Students for Data Science, a student association with the aim of bringing together like-minded individuals interested in Machine Learning and AI. Within a few weeks of its inception, we already had more than 200 members. During my _business years_, I also launched a startup project, which was called Dreamstyle. The idea was to match hairdressers and beauticians with their customers, with the service being home delivered. I created the Minimum Viable Product and defined the go-to-market strategy. Unfortunately my co-founder and I were not experienced, and lost trust in the startup when the first difficulties arose. 

After those years, I decided I wanted to become more proficient in Machine Learning. That's why I started my Master at EPFL. Here, I worked hard on my technical skills. I worked on research projects about Generative Adversarial Networks and Causal Representation learning. I became fascinated about researching hard topics, and improving the state of the art of something. 

I have always been captivated by human ingenuity and innovation as a whole. With a strong sense of optimism, I am constantly curious about what lies ahead. This is precisely why I have spent so many years studying Machine Learning. It is a field that is poised to make a significant impact on the course of human history, and I am eager to be a part of it.


I am a big fan of [Parkison's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law).
